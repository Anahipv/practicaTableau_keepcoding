# Average Rent Prices in Madrid using Tableau

## Project for KeepCoding's Tableau Course

Objectives:

Make a dashboard with graphs representing the rent prices in Madrid, all using the same KPI, the total average price (consisting of the sum of the rent, the deposity and the cleaning fee).

    One map representing the total average price by ZIP code and showing, as a tooltip, the property types with the greatest amount of reviews in the form of a bar graph.
    A bar graph showing the top N property types by the total average price, where the N can be modified by the viewer.
    A map with bubble overlay, showing as detail the host ID, the property type, and the ZIP code.
    A neighbourhood filter that affects the whole dashboard.
